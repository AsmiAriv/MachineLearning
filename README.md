#Machine Learning Project

##Weight Lifting - Barbell lifts classification
###A brief introduction
This paper deals with the analysis of the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The objective of this project is to come up with a predictive model using machine learning algorithm in order to predict the manner in which these particpants did the exercise.

Original source of data: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>

There are five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise while other classes correspond to common mistakes.

After running various models, cross validation and out of sample error analysis was found to be that decision tree and random forest performed exteremely well while boosting did not perform so well. However, for testing datasets (with 20 cases), random forest was the winner with 95% accuracy.
